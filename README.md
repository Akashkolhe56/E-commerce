E-commerce Project - Milestone 1

This document outlines the progress made in Milestone 1 of our e-commerce project. This milestone focused on setting up the basic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and creating a foundational order page.

MERN Stack Demonstration

This milestone successfully demonstrated the integration of the MERN stack:

M - MongoDB: Used as the database to store application data.

E - Express.js: Implemented as the API, acting as an intermediary between the client (React) and the server (Node.js).

R - React: Chosen as the client-side framework for building the user interface of the application.

N - Node.js: Used as the runtime environment for executing the Express.js server.

Key Accomplishments

Order Page: A basic order page was created, laying the groundwork for future order management features.
